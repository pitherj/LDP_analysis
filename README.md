# LDP Analysis

Statistical analysis of FAIR compliance scores for publications authored by Living Data Project (LDP) trainees versus matched controls, implementing the pre-registered inter-rater reliability and hypothesis-testing workflow.

---

## Background

The [Living Data Project (LDP)](https://www.ciee-icee.ca/ldp.html) is a Canada-wide graduate training program in open science, offered through the Canadian Institute of Ecology and Evolution (CIEE). This repository contains the analysis code for a quasi-experimental matched-groups study evaluating whether LDP training improved the FAIR compliance of graduates' published research data.

FAIR compliance (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) is assessed on a 0–4 scale by four independent raters using a standardised checklist. The primary outcome is the mean rater score per publication. Each LDP publication is matched within institution and publication year to a comparator publication from a non-LDP graduate student.

The full analysis plan is described in the [pre-registration on OSF](https://osf.io/uyqt4/files/xjmyg).

## Quick Start

```r
# 1. Clone the repository
# 2. Open LDP_analysis.Rproj in RStudio
# 3. Restore the R package library
renv::restore()
# 4. Open and render scripts/full_workflow.qmd
```

## Prerequisites

### Software

| Requirement | Version used | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| R | 4.5.2 | [cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org) |
| Quarto | ≥ 1.4 | [quarto.org](https://quarto.org) |
| RStudio | any recent | Recommended IDE; not required |

### R packages

R package dependencies are managed via `renv`. Restore the project library before first use:

**macOS / Linux**
```r
install.packages("renv")  # if not already installed
renv::restore()
```

**Windows**
```r
install.packages("renv")  # if not already installed
renv::restore()
```

> **macOS**: Packages with compiled code may require Xcode Command Line Tools (`xcode-select --install`).  
> **Windows**: Some packages with compiled code require [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) — match the Rtools version to your R version.

Key packages (all locked in `renv.lock`):

| Package | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `readr` | CSV import |
| `dplyr`, `tidyr`, `purrr` | Data wrangling |
| `irr` | Inter-rater reliability (ICC, Krippendorff's α, Fleiss' κ) |
| `effectsize` | Cohen's *d* |
| `ggplot2` | Visualisation |
| `here` | Portable file paths |

### Data

The four rater evaluation CSV files must be placed in `data/data_raw/` (see [Project Structure](#project-structure) below). The private pairing key (`rater_key_final_v2.csv`) must be placed in `data/data_raw/data_private/`. This folder is git-ignored; contact the project lead to obtain it.

## Analysis Workflow

All analysis is contained in `scripts/full_workflow.qmd`. The document is structured as follows:

1. **Import private key** (hidden chunk) — reads `rater_key_final_v2.csv`, strips to `pub_id`, `pair_id`, `group`, writes `pairs_lookup.csv`, then removes the object from the environment.
2. **Import rater data** — reads all four rater CSVs; confirms 38 publications are common to all four raters.
3. **Reformat to wide** — aligns per-rater scores into a single wide tibble (`scores_wide`); writes `rater_scores_wide.csv`.
4. **Inter-rater reliability** — ICC (two-way mixed, absolute agreement, average of *k* = 4 raters); Krippendorff's α (interval scale); percent agreement.
5. **Primary analysis** — computes mean FAIR score per publication, joins pairing lookup, calculates paired differences (*D* = LDP − Comparator), runs a one-sided permutation test (seed = 20260329, *n* = 1000).
6. **Secondary analysis** — one-sided paired *t*-test; Cohen's *d* via `effectsize`.
7. **Visualisation** — paired plot (one line per matched pair).

Render by opening `full_workflow.qmd` in RStudio and clicking Render, or from the terminal:

```bash
quarto render scripts/full_workflow.qmd
```
